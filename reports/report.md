## What Was Done
Jack

In this project, our aim is create the battleship game that can be played remotely between two players. Battle ship is a game wherein two players are given a 9 x 11 board and 5 ships. The ships are sized 1 x 1, 2 x 1, 3 x 1, 4 x 1, and 5 x 1, respectively. Without looking at each others' board, the two players randomly place the five ship on the board. Then, the players take turns, each guessing a block on the board in hopes that they have successfully "hit" the enemy ship. The first player to "hit" all of the opposing player's ships is the victor.  

To create the game, we first have to consider the essential components of our game. The most important aspects of our game are the network and the game rules. As such, we created a

## Design Decision
Jack

pivot from two client/one server to one client/one server

- time and overscoped, not necessary given scope, only need two users, etc

## Code Snippets
Julian

Network: basic socket stuff, delays

Data Storage: struct and storing board
