1. We plan to make a terminal-based simple game that incorporates network capabilities to play on multiple computers. Our lower bound involves a text-based, one-on-one battleship game. We hope to be able to connect two computers so two users can play against one another

2. We want to learn about network programming (creating a client, establishing connection, etc). This will involve reading materials that don't arrive until later in the class, and doing a great deal of studying previous projects' code. Specifically, hackerchat contains tons of relevant documentation and code for our project.

3. The largest part of the project that we don't have much experience in is network programming. Luckily, groups in previous semesters have worked with such programming so we can look at their resources as a starting point for ourselves. When it comes to making the game, we aren't as worried as that is mostly console-based input processing.

4. Immediate Tasks:
